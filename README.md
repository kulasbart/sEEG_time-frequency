# sEEG time-frequency domain workflow

Input: file.edf neural time series data

Includes preprocessing steps, computation of spectrogram for time and frequency domain analyses of multichannel intracranial EEG data (EDF+), and tools to inspect multichannel eeg timeseries data. 


---IN PROGRESS---

Future additions: hilbert transform, phase locking value, z-score normalization. Also planning to expand the workflow to inspect phase coupling across ieeg channels
